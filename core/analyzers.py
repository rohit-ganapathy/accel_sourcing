Company analysis using AI to generate 5-dimensional perspectives for embeddings.

This module creates 5 different analytical perspectives of each company:
1. Company Description - What the company does (business overview)
2. ICP Analysis - Who they serve (customer perspective) 
3. Jobs-to-be-Done - What problems they solve (solution perspective)
4. Industry Vertical - Market positioning (industry perspective)
5. Product Form - How they deliver value (product perspective)

        Analyze this company website content and create 5 comprehensive company profiles from different analytical perspectives. Each perspective should capture the ENTIRE COMPANY as viewed through that specific lens, creating rich embeddings for nuanced similarity matching.

        ---
        {content[:4000]}  # Limit content to avoid token limits
        ---

        Create 5 complete COMPANY PROFILES from these perspectives:

        1. **COMPANY DESCRIPTION PERSPECTIVE (Business Overview Lens)**
           Write a comprehensive company profile focusing on:
           - Core business model and fundamental value proposition
           - Primary products/services and how they work together
           - Unique market position and competitive advantages
           - Business strategy and growth approach
           - Key innovations and differentiators
           - Overall company mission and vision
           (This should read like a complete company overview from a business strategy perspective)

        2. **CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE (ICP & Market Lens)**
           Write a comprehensive company profile focusing on:
           - Detailed ideal customer profiles and target segments
           - Customer pain points and needs they address
           - Customer journey and buying behavior patterns
           - Market segments and customer demographics
           - Customer success stories and use cases
           - How the company positions itself to different customer types
           (This should read like a complete company overview from a customer-focused perspective)

        3. **SOLUTION PERSPECTIVE (Jobs-to-be-Done Lens)**
           Write a comprehensive company profile focusing on:
           - Specific problems and challenges they solve
           - Functional, emotional, and social jobs they help with
           - Outcomes and results they deliver to customers
           - Value creation and impact on customer success
           - Problem-solution fit and market validation
           - Success metrics and customer transformation
           (This should read like a complete company overview from a solution-delivery perspective)

        4. **MARKET POSITIONING PERSPECTIVE (Industry & Ecosystem Lens)**
           Write a comprehensive company profile focusing on:
           - Industry category and market ecosystem they operate in
           - Competitive landscape and positioning strategy
           - Market trends and industry dynamics they leverage
           - Partnerships and ecosystem relationships
           - Market share and competitive advantages
           - Industry thought leadership and influence
           (This should read like a complete company overview from a market analysis perspective)

        5. **PRODUCT DELIVERY PERSPECTIVE (Go-to-Market & Model Lens)**
           Write a comprehensive company profile focusing on:
           - Product architecture and delivery mechanisms
           - Technology stack and platform approach
           - Go-to-market strategy and sales approach
           - Pricing model and revenue streams
           - Distribution channels and customer acquisition
           - Product development and innovation process
           (This should read like a complete company overview from a product and delivery perspective)

        IMPORTANT: Each perspective should be a COMPLETE 250-400 word company profile that could stand alone as a comprehensive description of the company. Avoid bullet points - write flowing, descriptive paragraphs that capture the full company essence from that viewpoint.
