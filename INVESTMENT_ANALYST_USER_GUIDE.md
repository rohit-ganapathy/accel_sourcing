## üìä Understanding Your Results

### Result Format Explanation
When you run a search, you get results like this:

```json
{
  "query_company": "Stripe",
  "total_results": 15,
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Square",
      "website": "https://square.com",
      "final_score": 0.847,
      "sources": ["internal", "harmonic"],
      "similarity_reasons": [
        "Both focus on payment processing for small businesses",
        "Similar product ecosystem with hardware + software",
        "Target similar customer segments (SMBs, enterprises)"
      ],
      "confidence": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Metrics to Focus On

**Final Score (0.0 - 1.0)**:
- `0.8+` = Very similar (strong competitor/peer)
- `0.6-0.8` = Moderately similar (same space, different focus)  
- `0.4-0.6` = Somewhat similar (adjacent market/model)
- `<0.4` = Loosely similar (different but related)

**Sources**:
- `internal` = Found in your existing database
- `harmonic` = Discovered via Harmonic startup database
- `gpt` = AI-generated suggestions from company analysis

**Confidence Levels**:
- `high` = Strong analytical confidence
- `medium` = Good match with some uncertainty
- `low` = Potential match, needs human review

### Export Formats

**JSON**: Best for technical analysis, detailed data
```bash
--format json --output results.json
```

**CSV**: Perfect for Excel analysis, sharing with team
```bash  
--format csv --output results.csv
```

**HTML**: Beautiful reports for presentations
```bash
--format html --output results.html
```

## üéØ Advanced Search Strategies

### Strategy 1: Customer-Focused Similarity
**When to use**: Finding companies that serve the same customers

```bash
python3 internal_search.py \
    --company "https://target-company.com" \
    --weight-profile "customer_focused" \
    --top-n 12 \
    --output customer_similar.json
```

### Strategy 2: Product-Focused Similarity  
**When to use**: Finding companies with similar products/technology

```bash
python3 internal_search.py \
    --company "https://target-company.com" \
    --weight-profile "product_focused" \
    --top-n 12 \
    --output product_similar.json
```

### Strategy 3: Conservative vs Aggressive Scoring
**Conservative** (finds only very similar companies):
```bash
python3 internal_search.py \
    --company "https://target-company.com" \
    --scoring-strategy "harmonic_mean" \
    --top-n 8
```

**Aggressive** (broader similarity, more results):
```bash
python3 internal_search.py \
    --company "https://target-company.com" \
    --scoring-strategy "exponential_decay" \
    --top-n 20
```

### Strategy 4: Source-Specific Searches

**Internal Only** (search your own database):
```bash
python3 company_similarity_search.py \
    "https://company.com" \
    --internal-only \
    --top-n 15
```

**External Only** (discover new companies):
```bash
python3 company_similarity_search.py \
    "https://company.com" \
    --external-only \
    --top-n 20
```

**Custom Balance** (70% internal, 30% external):
```bash
python3 company_similarity_search.py \
    "https://company.com" \
    --internal-weight 0.7 \
    --external-weight 0.3 \
    --top-n 25
```

## üöÄ Best Practices for Investment Analysis

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
```bash
# Step 1: Cast wide net
python3 company_similarity_search.py \
    "https://company.com" \
    --top-n 50 \
    --output broad_search.csv \
    --format csv

# Step 2: Analyze top 10 manually
# Step 3: Deep dive on most promising 3-5
```

### 2. Use Multiple Similarity Approaches
```bash
# Customer-focused view
python3 internal_search.py \
    --company "https://company.com" \
    --weight-profile "customer_focused" \
    --output customer_view.json

# Product-focused view  
python3 internal_search.py \
    --company "https://company.com" \
    --weight-profile "product_focused" \
    --output product_view.json

# Compare results across approaches
```

### 3. Build Your Own Database
```bash
# Regularly index companies you're tracking
python3 crm_indexer.py \
    --csv-file monthly_pipeline.csv \
    --max-companies 200

# This improves future search quality
```

### 4. Document Your Findings
Always export results for future reference:
```bash
# Create comprehensive reports
python3 company_similarity_search.py \
    "https://company.com" \
    --top-n 20 \
    --format html \
    --output "$(date +%Y%m%d)_company_analysis.html" \
    --stats
```

## üö® Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues

**"No similar companies found"**:
- Try external-only search: add `--external-only`
- Lower similarity threshold: increase `--top-n` to 30+
- Check if company URL is accessible

**"System seems slow"**:
- Normal for external searches (30-60 seconds)
- Use `--internal-only` for faster results
- Reduce `--top-n` for quicker responses

**"Results don't make sense"**:
- Try different `--weight-profile` options
- Use `--scoring-strategy "harmonic_mean"` for more conservative results
- Always validate results with business judgment

### Getting Help

**Quick System Check**:
```bash
./quick_health_check.sh
```

**Check What's in Database**:
```bash
python3 -c "
from core.storage import ChromaDBManager
storage = ChromaDBManager()
companies = storage.get_all_companies()
print(f'Database has {len(companies)} companies')
for company in companies[:10]:
    print(f'  - {company}')
"
